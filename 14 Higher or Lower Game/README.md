# Creating a Guessing Game: Higher or Lower:
- Comparing instagram follower counts for random accounts from a list of dictionaries - "data".

## Quick Notes:
1. Today was a review of previous learned topics, so the notes file is rather simple.
2. The code for the game starts on line 342 of the notes file, following the data and ASCII art.
3. I know correctamundo sounds corny, but I like it :-P
