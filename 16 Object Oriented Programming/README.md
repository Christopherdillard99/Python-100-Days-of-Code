# Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Revisiting the Coffee Machine:

## Topics Covered:
1. OOP vs. Procedural Programming and benefits / use-cases
2. Classes (written in PascalCase) and objects (written in snake_case)
3. searching PyPi (Python Package Index) and importing packages.
   - ex: from foodrecipes import FoodRecipes
4. create object from Class
   - ex: food_recipes = FoodRecipes()
6. object_name.attribute = value
   - an attribute is what the object has or a descriptor
   - ex: food_recipes.spice_level = "thai hot" 
8. object_name.method()
   - a method is what the object does.
   - note that the method() always has a pair of parentheses when its called and the attributes simply modified by assigning a value with an equal sign.
   - ex: food_recipes.add_ingredient("chicken")
