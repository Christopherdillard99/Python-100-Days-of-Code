# Day 20: Snake Game - Part 1:

## Topics covered today:
1. Continuing Object-Oriented Programming and correctly created classes (blueprints).
2. Assigning CONSTANT_VALUES to easily change these as desired in one place instead of modifying throughout entire code line-by-line.
3. More on keyboard listeners in Python (ex. user inputs as keyboard strokes in the arrow keys that trigger certain turtle movements).
   - the listener is waiting for an "event" to trigger it. The pressing of the "UP" arrow key would be the event that triggers the snake.up() function.
5. Entering "Pass" keyword in methods within classes as a placeholder for future code
   - the anticipated function has a name but its block of code will be ignored when running the program to avoid error messages.
