# Day 18: Hirst Painting Project:
### The idea of this project come from [this piece](https://www.phillips.com/detail/damien-hirst/UK010120/16) selling for a fortune.

## Topics Covered Today:
1. In depth coverage of the turtle graphics package
2. Tuples in Python being immutable and RGB (red, green, blue) colors - remember 255.
3. Getting creative with Python and tailoring the code to meet specific interests once the general functionality is met.

## But first - check out this Spirograph using turtle:
